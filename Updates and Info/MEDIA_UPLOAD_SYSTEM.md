const STATIC_FILES = [
    '/',
    '/static/css/style.css',
    '/static/js/media-upload.js',
    // ... other static assets
];

// Handle offline media requests
async function handleMediaRequest(request) {
    const cache = await caches.open(MEDIA_CACHE);
    const cachedResponse = await cache.match(request);
    
    if (cachedResponse) {
        return cachedResponse;
    }
    
    // Fallback for uncached media
    return new Response('Media not available offline');
}
```

### Offline Queue Management
```javascript
class MediaUploadManager {
    addToOfflineQueue(file, type, workOrderId, commentId = null) {
        const queueItem = {
            id: Date.now() + Math.random(),
            file: file,
            type: type,
            workOrderId: workOrderId,
            commentId: commentId,
            timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
        };
        
        this.offlineQueue.push(queueItem);
        this.saveOfflineQueue();
    }
}
```

### Background Sync
- Automatic sync when connection is restored
- Queue processing with retry logic
- Progress indicators for sync operations
- Conflict resolution for concurrent edits

## File Management

### Upload Directory Structure
```
static/uploads/
â”œâ”€â”€ work_orders/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 20241201_143022_image1.jpg
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 20241201_143025_video1.mp4
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 20241201_143030_voice1.wav
â””â”€â”€ comments/
    â”œâ”€â”€ 20241201_143035_comment1.jpg
    â””â”€â”€ 20241201_143040_comment2.mp4
```

### File Naming Convention
- Format: `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_microseconds_filename.ext`

## Performance Optimizations

### Image Compression
```javascript
async compressImage(file) {
    const canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
    const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
    
    // Resize to max 1920px width/height
    const maxSize = 1920;
    let { width, height } = img;
    
    if (width > height) {
        if (width > maxSize) {
            height = (height * maxSize) / width;
            width = maxSize;
        }
    }
    
    // Compress with 80% quality
    canvas.toBlob(blob => {
        const compressedFile = new File([blob], file.name, {
            type: 'image/jpeg',
            lastModified: Date.now()
        });
    }, 'image/jpeg', 0.8);
}
```

        const result = await mediaUploadManager.uploadFile(file, 'image', 1);
        expect(result.success).toBe(true);
    });
    
    test('should handle offline upload', async () => {
        // Simulate offline mode
        navigator.onLine = false;
        const file = new File(['test'], 'test.jpg', { type: 'image/jpeg' });
        const result = await mediaUploadManager.uploadFile(file, 'image', 1);
        expect(result.offline).toBe(true);
    });
});
```
