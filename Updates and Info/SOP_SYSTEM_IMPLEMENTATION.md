# SOP System Implementation - Point 2: Recurring Maintenance Tasks / SOPs

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) system and enhanced maintenance scheduling features for the CMMS application.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
- **SOP Management**: Create, edit, view, and delete SOPs
- **Checklist Items**: Each SOP can have multiple checklist items with:
  - Description and order
  - Required vs optional items
  - Expected results
- **SOP Categories**: PM, Safety, Operation, Emergency, Other
- **Equipment Association**: SOPs can be linked to specific equipment
- **Safety Notes**: Important safety considerations for each SOP
- **Required Tools & Parts**: Lists of necessary tools and parts

### 2. Enhanced Maintenance Schedules
- **SOP Integration**: Maintenance schedules can be linked to SOPs
- **Team Assignment**: Assign maintenance tasks to specific teams
- **Automatic Work Order Creation**: Generate work orders from maintenance schedules
- **Next Due Calculation**: Automatic calculation of next due dates based on frequency

### 3. Calendar View
- **FullCalendar Integration**: Interactive calendar showing upcoming maintenance tasks
- **Filtering**: Filter by equipment, team, and priority
- **Event Details**: Click events to see detailed information
- **Navigation**: Month, week, day, and list views

### 4. Work Order Integration
- **Checklist Items**: Work orders created from SOP-linked schedules automatically include checklist items
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bar showing completion percentage
- **Notes System**: Add notes to individual checklist items
- **Completion Tracking**: Track who completed each item and when

## Use Case Implementation: "Grease conveyor belt rollers every Monday 8 AM"

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Create SOP**:
   - Navigate to `/sops/new`
   - Create "Conveyor Belt Lubrication" SOP
   - Add checklist items:
     - Stop conveyor and lock out power
     - Inspect rollers for damage
     - Apply grease to roller bearings
     - Test conveyor operation
     - Document maintenance

2. **Create Maintenance Schedule**:
   - Navigate to equipment detail page
   - Click "Add Schedule"
   - Set frequency: Weekly, every 1 week
   - Set next due: Next Monday 8:00 AM
   - Select the created SOP
   - Assign to maintenance team

3. **Calendar View**:
   - Navigate to `/calendar`
   - View upcoming maintenance tasks
   - Filter by equipment or team

4. **Create Work Order**:
   - From equipment detail page, click the green "Create Work Order" button on the maintenance schedule
   - Work order is automatically created with:
     - Title: "PM: Conveyor Belt Lubrication"
     - All checklist items from SOP
     - Assigned to the team
     - Scheduled for Monday 8 AM

5. **Execute Work Order**:
   - Technician opens work order
   - Follows checklist items step by step
   - Checks off completed items
   - Adds notes if needed
   - Completes work order

6. **Automatic Updates**:
   - Maintenance schedule updates last performed date
   - Next due date automatically calculated (next Monday 8 AM)
   - Progress tracked in work order

## Navigation Updates

Added to main navigation:
- **SOPs** - Manage Standard Operating Procedures
- **Calendar** - View maintenance calendar

## Sample Data

The migration script creates a sample "Conveyor Belt Maintenance" SOP with 7 checklist items covering:
- Safety procedures (lockout/tagout)
- Inspection tasks
- Cleaning and lubrication
- Testing and documentation

## Benefits

1. **Standardization**: Consistent procedures across all maintenance tasks
2. **Compliance**: Ensures safety procedures are followed
3. **Training**: New technicians can follow detailed checklists
4. **Quality**: Reduces errors and ensures nothing is missed
5. **Tracking**: Complete audit trail of maintenance activities
6. **Efficiency**: Automated work order creation and scheduling

## Next Steps

1. Run the migration script: `python migrate_sop_system.py`
2. Start the application: `python app.py`
3. Navigate to `/sops` to create your first SOP
4. Create maintenance schedules with SOP assignments
5. Use the calendar view to monitor upcoming tasks
6. Generate work orders from schedules and execute with checklists

## Technical Notes

- FullCalendar.js integration for calendar functionality
- Bootstrap modals for checklist management
- Progress tracking with visual indicators
- Automatic date calculations for recurring schedules
- Image upload support for work orders and comments
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop use
