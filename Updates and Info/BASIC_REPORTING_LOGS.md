```

### API Endpoints for Reporting
```python
# Reporting APIs
GET  /reports              # Main dashboard
GET  /reports/task-logs    # Filtered task logs
GET  /reports/performance-metrics # Performance analytics
GET  /reports/equipment-analytics # Equipment analytics

on_time_work_orders = WorkOrder.query.filter(
    WorkOrder.status == 'completed',
    WorkOrder.actual_end_time <= WorkOrder.due_date
).count()

# Calculate percentages
completion_rate = (completed_work_orders / total_work_orders * 100)
